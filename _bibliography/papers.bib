In Bitcoin-like protocols, each block is always mined by all miners, which implies a design philosophy that all transactions should be protected with the highest security. As a result, the throughput is bounded in these protocols. In real-world applications, the security requirement of transactions differs. Therefore, we present B++, a scalable blockchain structure, which breaks the limits of blockchain security so that B++ can distribute system resources efficiently to confirm transactions with different requirements. In our analysis, we show that B++ inherits eventual consistency in Bitcoin-like protocols. Moreover, our open-source simulation indicates that the throughput of B++ can be more than 100 times greater than that of baseline approaches; besides, the number of timeout transactions in B++ can decrease by up to 70% than that in a Bitcoin-like blockchain.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/ICC42927.2021.9500338},  ISSN={1938-1883},  month={June}, pdf = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9500338}, preview={bpp.png}}

abstract = {With the rising influence of current online services, it is important for service providers to discover related accounts because it helps detect suspicious account groups. Existing research on this topic mostly focuses on a variety of account behaviors. Little attention has been paid to relations among account identity, which unveils the relationship between accounts and real-world people. In this paper, we propose DRAGON for modeling an account identity network and detecting suspicious account groups among this network. To this end, identifiers for tracking physical devices are collected and uncertain graph is used for modeling uncertainty in the network. Within this network, a strategy for detecting suspicious account groups is also investigated in DRAGON. We evaluate DRAGON using a real-world dataset. The results indicate that DRAGON achieves a 280% improvement in precision and 150% improvement in recall compared to a binary classifier.},

abstract = {Social metaverse with VR has been viewed as a paradigm shift for
social media. However, most traditional VR social platforms ignore
emerging characteristics in a metaverse, thereby failing to boost
user satisfaction. In this paper, we explore a scenario of socializing
in metaverse with VR, which brings major advantages over conven-
tional social media: 1) leverage flexible display of usersâ€™ 360-degree
viewports to satisfy individual user interests, 2) ensure the user
feelings of co-existence, 3) prevent view obstruction to help users
find friends in crowds, and 4) support socializing with digital twins.
Therefore, we formulate the Co-presence, and Occlusion-aware
Metaverse User Recommendation (COMUR) problem to recom-
mend a set of rendered players for users in social metaverse with
VR. We prove COMUR is an NP-hard optimization problem and
design a dual-module deep graph learning framework (COMURNet)
to recommend appropriate users for viewport display. Experimen-
tal results on real social metaverse datasets and a user study with
Occulus Quest 2 manifest that the proposed model outperforms
baseline approaches by at least 36.7% of solution quality.},

title = {Targeted Influence with Community and Gender-Aware Seeding},
year = {2022},
month = {October},
booktitle = {Proceedings of the 31st ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM)},
abstract = {When spreading information over social networks, seeding algorithms selecting users to start the dissemination play a crucial role. The majority of existing seeding algorithms focus solely on maximizing the total number of reached nodes, overlooking the issue of group fairness, in particular, gender imbalance. To tackle the challenge of maximizing information spread on certain target groups, e.g., females, we introduce the concept of the community and gender-aware potential of users. We first show that the network's community structure is closely related to the gender distribution. Then, we propose an algorithm that leverages the information about community structure and its gender potential to iteratively modify a seed set such that the information spread on the target group meets the target ratio. Finally, we validate the algorithm by performing experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. Our results show that the proposed seeding algorithm achieves not only the target ratio but also the highest information spread, compared to the state-of-the-art gender-aware seeding algorithm.},
