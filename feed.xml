I spend most of my time to study how zkSNARKs work and how to apply them to real-world applications. In my free time, I enjoy watching movies and playing games. My favorite movies includes Interstellar, Shrek, and About Time. My favorite games are the series of The Legend of Zelda.</p> <p>I also enjoy exploring the local restaurants and coffee shops with my family (wife and daughter). If you ask me about the best restaurants in this area, I would sincerely recommend you to have cakes at <a href="https://suzusbakery.com/">Suzu’s Bakery</a> and meals at <a href="https://www.83viet.com/">83</a>. If you are willing to drive a little bit further, you can try <a href="https://www.yoderskitchen.net/">Yoder’s Kitchen</a>. You won’t regret it!</p> <p>Btw, I am a Buddhist and I practice to cultivate my compassion and wisdom based on the teachings of the Buddha. (Though I still have a long way to go.)</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="sample-posts"/><category term="links"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[hello!]]></summary></entry></feed>
