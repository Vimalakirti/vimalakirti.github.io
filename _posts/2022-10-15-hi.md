Hi, my name is Bing-Jyue Chen, welcome to my website. I spend most of my time to study how zkSNARKs work and how to apply them to real-world applications.
In my free time, I enjoy watching movies and playing games. My favorite movies includes Interstellar, Shrek, and About Time. My favorite games are the series of The Legend of Zelda.

I also enjoy exploring the local restaurants and coffee shops with my family (wife and daughter). If you ask me about the best restaurants in this area, I would sincerely recommend you to have cakes at [Suzu's Bakery](https://suzusbakery.com/) and meals at [83](https://www.83viet.com/). If you are willing to drive a little bit further, you can try [Yoder's Kitchen](https://www.yoderskitchen.net/). You won't regret it!

Btw, I am a Buddhist and I practice to cultivate my compassion and wisdom based on the teachings of the Buddha. (Though I still have a long way to go.)
