I will be a 1st-year PhD student at UIUC in the computer science department from fall 2023. I am currently a research assistant in the [Institute of Information Science](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/en/index.html) at [Academia Sinica](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en). I am currently working on user recommendation, influence maximization, and geometric deep learning supervised by [Prof. De-Nian Yang](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/dnyang/vita_en.html). My research interests focus on geometric deep learning, cybersecurity and web3 technologies.

Before coming to Academia Sinica, I received my B.S. and M.S. in [Electrical Engineering](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php) and [Communication Engineering](https://comm.ntu.edu.tw/en/) from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). I have worked with [Prof. Tsungnan Lin](https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?id=76) on blockchain scalability and anomaly detection in device networks.
