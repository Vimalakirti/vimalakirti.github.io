I am a first-year PhD student in [Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/) at [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/). With [Prof. Daniel Kang](https://ddkang.github.io/), my current research focuses on zero knowledge machine learning (zkml). I am also interested in privacy-preserving machine learning, advanced cryptography, and blockchain.

From 2021 to 2023, I was a research assistant in the [Institute of Information Science](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/en/index.html) at [Academia Sinica](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en), supervised by [Prof. De-Nian Yang](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/dnyang/vita_en.html). Before that, I received my B.S. and M.S. in [Electrical Engineering](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php) and [Communication Engineering](https://comm.ntu.edu.tw/en/) from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). I have worked with [Prof. Tsungnan Lin](https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?id=76) on Proof-of-Work based blockchain scalability and anomaly detection in browser fingerprinting networks.
