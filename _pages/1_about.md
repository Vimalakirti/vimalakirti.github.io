I am a 3rd-year PhD student in [Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/) at [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/). My current research focuses on zero knowledge machine learning (zkml) with [Prof. Daniel Kang](https://ddkang.github.io/). I am also interested in privacy-preserving machine learning, and advanced cryptography.

To learn more about me, please refer to my [CV](https://vimalakirti.github.io/assets/pdf/chenbingjyue_resume.pdf).
